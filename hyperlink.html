<p>Career</p>
<p>Main article: Kajal Aggarwal filmography
Film debut and struggles (2004â€“08)
Aggarwal made her acting debut in the 2004 Bollywood film Kyun...! Ho Gaya Na, in which she had a minor supporting role.[19][20] She appeared in veteran Tamil director Bharathiraja's Bommalattam, alongside Arjun Sarja. The film was delayed and released in late 2008.
Aggarwal made her debut in the Telugu film industry and played her first leading role in 2007 in Teja's Lakshmi Kalyanam, alongside Kalyan Ram; it did not fare well at the box office. Later that year, she appeared in the Krishna Vamsi-directed Chandamama, which opened to positive reviews and became her first major successful film.[21] In 2008, she had her first Tamil film release, Perarasu's action entertainer Pazhani, co-starring Bharath. She had two more Tamil releases that year with Venkat Prabhu's comedy-thriller Saroja, in which she did a guest appearance, and Bharathiraja's investigative thriller Bommalattam. Although the former went on to become a commercial as well as a critical success,[22] both films failed to boost her career as her roles were too insignificant.[23] Her Telugu releases Pourudu and Aatadista opposite Sumanth and Nitin, respectively, did not receive positive reviews, but both were successful at the box office.</p>

<p>Public recognition and critical acclaim</p>
<p>Aggarwal had four releases in 2009. She first starred opposite Vinay Rai in the Tamil film Modhi Vilayadu, which garnered mixed reviews and was a financial failure. She then appeared in the high budget Telugu historical drama Magadheera, alongside Ram Charan Teja, which saw her playing double roles for the first time. The film, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, received overwhelming critical acclaim, while Aggarwal, in particular, was praised for her portrayal of a princess. Aggarwal was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Telugu and nominated for the award for Best Telugu Actress in the South Scope Awards for her performance.[24][25] It was highly successful commercially and broke several records,[26] emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time.[27][28][29] Magadheera's success turned Aggarwal into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema.[30] It was released again in Tamil as Maaveeran in 2011, and was also successful at the box office.[31] Her subsequent releases Ganesh Just Ganesh, opposite Ram and Arya 2 opposite Allu Arjun received mixed reviews from critics, while her performance garnered positive feedback.[32][33]
Aggarwal's first 2010 release was A. Karunakaran's romantic comedy Darling, which featured her alongside Prabhas and received a favourable response, becoming a commercial success at the box office,[34] with Kajal receiving her second Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. Later that year, Aggarwal appeared in the Tamil thriller film Naan Mahaan Alla, opposite Karthi, which was based on a real-life incident and opened to positive reviews.[35] It was a box office success. The chemistry between Karthi and Aggarwal was widely praised.[36] It was later dubbed in Telugu as Naa Peru Siva in Andhra Pradesh and was a success.[37] Aggarwal's final release in 2010 was another romantic comedy Brindavanam opposite Jr. NTR and Samantha, which received critical acclaim and went on to become a commercial success,[38] while fetching Aggarwal the CineMAA Award for Best Actress.
In 2011, Aggarwal was paired with Prabhas for the second time in the romantic comedy Mr. Perfect, directed by Dasaradh. The film became a critical and commercial success. Aggarwal's performance as a conservative doctor and her chemistry with Prabhas was praised by critics.[39][40] Aggarwal received her third Filmfare nomination for Best Actress in Telugu for her performance.[41] In May, she appeared in Veera, replacing Anushka Shetty[42] and starring opposite Ravi Teja for the first time.[43] The film received moderate reviews.[44]</p>
